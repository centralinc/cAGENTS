# Project Context

**Owner:** LocalOverride
**Communication Style:** concise
**Current Branch:** 

**Local Note:** This variable only exists in local config


When working on this project, maintain a concise communication style.

## TypeScript

- Prefer explicit types; avoid `any`.
- Run typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`.
- See [System Models](docs/system-design/models.md) for domain entities.

## Rust Code Guidelines

**For this directory:**

- Use `rustfmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- Add doc comments (`///`) for public items
- Use `#[must_use]` for functions that return important values

## Working with cAGENTS

This file was generated by cAGENTS. To work efficiently with this codebase:

1. **Run once at start of session**: `cagents build` ensures all agent rules are up-to-date
2. **Get file-specific context**: `cagents context <filename>` retrieves all relevant rules for a specific file - more efficient than reading this entire file
3. **Best practice**: Re-run `cagents build` when context seems stale or after pulling changes
